<h2><a name="Targets">RNA Targets (Hybridizations) File</a></h2>
<p>The RNA Targets file, also know as the Hybridizations file, lists the microarray hybridizations and includes
for each chip, the name of the CEL file (Cell Intensity File) for that chip, which contains probe-level
Perfect Match (PM) and MisMatch (MM) intensities.  The Targets file should be in <b>tab-delimited text format</b>,
A Targets file has three essential columns : <b>Name</b>, <b>FileName</b> and <b>Target</b>.  The <b>Name</b>
column should contain a unique name or number for each chip.  The <b>FileName</b> column should contain the names
of the CEL files.  The <b>Target</b> column should contain a name of the type of RNA being hybridized to that
chip, which is used to identify replicate chips.  For example, in the Estrogen example, the first two chips
have different names: "Abs10.1" and "Abs10.2", but they have the same RNA target, "EstAbsent10".  Extra
columns can be added if desired, but currently, only the <b>Name</b>, <b>FileName</b> and <b>Target</b> columns
are used.</p>

<p>An example is shown below.</p>

<h2><a name="CDFandAnnotation">CDF and Annotation Packages</h2>
<p>Currently there is no way to manually specify a Chip Definition File (CDF).  It is downloaded
automatically from
<a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/data/metaData.html">http://www.bioconductor.org/data/metaData.html</a>.
If you are using an Affymetrix chip which is not listed on this webpage, please contact the Bioconductor
mailing list at <a href="mailto:bioconductor@stat.math.ethz.ch">bioconductor@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>.</p>

<p>The webpage <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/data/metaData.html">http://www.bioconductor.org/data/metaData.html</a>
also provides annotation packages for many commonly used Affymetrix chips.  These packages contain gene symbols,
gene names, UniGene IDs, and IDs for linking to many other useful sources of gene information.  If you are using
a chip which does not have an annotation package available on this webpage, you may find that <b><i>affylmGUI</i></b>
tries to download an annotation package repeatedly, even when it may not exist.  This problem will be fixed in future
versions of <b><i>affylmGUI</i></b>.  As with the CDF package, if you have a chip which has no annotation package on
the webpage mentioned previously, feel free to discuss this on the Bioconductor mailing list at
<a href="mailto:bioconductor@stat.math.ethz.ch">bioconductor@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>.</p>
